### Models

- `models/` directory contains classes used for this project:
- The class `BaseModel` defines all common attributes/methods for other classes and is the base class for the project.
- Other classes that inherit from the `BaseModel` class include:
  - `User`
  - `Place`
  - `City`
  - `Amenity`
  - `State`
  - `Review`
- The `FileStorage` class serializes instances of all the classes above to a JSON file and also deserializes JSON file to instances.

### Tests

All tests of the application are located in the `tests/` folder.
To execute all unit tests, run:
`python3 -m unittest discover tests `
from the root directory. Adding option `-v` reduces verbosity of the results
